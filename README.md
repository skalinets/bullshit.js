Bullshit.js is a best-of-breed, mission-critical enterprise JavaScript bookmarklet that will empower you to evaluate the high impact of market-driven text on any Web resource, cultivating process-centric innovation and out-of-the-box thinking.

To use it, add the following address as a bookmark and click on it when you're on any page that needs translation.



```js
javascript:(function(){var d=document,s=d.createElement('script');s.src='https://raw.github.com/mourner/bullshit.js/master/bullshit.js';d.body.appendChild(s);}())
```

Or just drag this link to your bookmarks: [Bullshit It](javascript:\(function\(\)\{var d=document,s=d.createElement\('script'\);s.src='https://raw.github.com/mourner/bullshit.js/master/bullshit.js';d.body.appendChild\(s\);\}\(\)\)
)

P.S. Happily accepting pull requests!
